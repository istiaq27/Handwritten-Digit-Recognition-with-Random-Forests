# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Random Forests algorithm

This work shows how random forests can be used to learn a model to classify and predict handwritten digits. First, the 28x28 greyscale images of handwritten digits are imported as a vector of length 784 with values between 0 and 255. The training data also contains their labels (the number it displays). Then, the random forest classifier is learnt and applied to the test data.
# Data Set
The data set is taken from the respective kaggle.com challenge, and you can find my kernel here: https://www.kaggle.com/michaelnie/simple-random-forest-classification/
